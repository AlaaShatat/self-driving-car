## Lane line detection stage
### Run the code from the shell script 
### Make sure to download the code with all files. 
1. Open git bash. 
2. Run this command: bash script.sh input\_path output\_path mode.
- Input\_path example: "C:\Users\Wiin11\Downloads\challenge\_video.mp4".
- Output\_path example: "C:\Users\Wiin11\Downloads\output.mp4".
- Mode: to switch between normal and debug modes.
- If mode = 0, then the normal mode will be applied and the front view video will be generated.
- If mode = 1, then the debug mode will be applied and a video with different stages will be generated. Â 
3. Check the ouput\_path to get the output video.
### Jupyter notebook
1. Install anaconda, then launch jupyter notebook. 
2. Open the "code.ipynb" file.
3. Run the code block by block to see the output at different stages.
4. Make sure that the videos to be tested are in the same directory.
5. The output video will be generated.
